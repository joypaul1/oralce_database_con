To check the total size of an Oracle database, you can use the following queries that provide information on the total space allocated and used:

1. Checking Total Size of the Database
SELECT SUM(bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 AS "Database Size (GB)"
FROM dba_data_files;
This query will give you the total size of all data files in the database, measured in gigabytes (GB).

2. Checking the Total Size of the Database (including TEMP files)


SELECT 
    SUM(bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 AS "Total Size (GB)"
FROM 
    (SELECT bytes FROM dba_data_files
     UNION ALL
     SELECT bytes FROM dba_temp_files);
This version includes temporary files, which can be important for understanding the entire disk usage.

3. Checking Total Space Used and Free Space
To check the total space used and free space within the database tablespaces:



SELECT 
    df.tablespace_name,
    df.total_space / 1024 / 1024 "Total Space (MB)",
    fs.free_space / 1024 / 1024 "Free Space (MB)",
    (df.total_space - fs.free_space) / 1024 / 1024 "Used Space (MB)"
FROM 
    (SELECT tablespace_name, SUM(bytes) total_space
     FROM dba_data_files
     GROUP BY tablespace_name) df,
    (SELECT tablespace_name, SUM(bytes) free_space
     FROM dba_free_space
     GROUP BY tablespace_name) fs
WHERE 
    df.tablespace_name = fs.tablespace_name;
This query provides a breakdown of the used and free space within each tablespace.

4. Checking Database Size from DBA_SEGMENTS
You can also use DBA_SEGMENTS to get the size of all segments (tables, indexes, etc.):



SELECT SUM(bytes) / 1024 / 1024 / 1024 AS "Total Size (GB)" FROM dba_segments;
